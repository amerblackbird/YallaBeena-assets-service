# Assets Service

## Overview

The Assets Service is a microservice designed to manage activity logs with both HTTP and gRPC APIs. It provides event-driven architecture with Kafka integration and caching capabilities with Redis.

## ✅ Completed Features

### gRPC Integration

- ✅ Added gRPC server alongside existing HTTP server
- ✅ Created protobuf definitions for ActivityLogsService
- ✅ Implemented gRPC handlers for:
  - LogActivity
  - GetActivityLogByID  
  - GetActivityLogsByUserID
  - HealthCheck
- ✅ Added gRPC client example
- ✅ Updated configuration to support gRPC port
- ✅ Added Docker Compose for development environment
- ✅ Created Makefile for common development tasks

### API Endpoints

- ✅ HTTP API running on port 8080
- ✅ gRPC API running on port 9090
- ✅ Health check endpoints for both protocols

### Infrastructure

- ✅ PostgreSQL database integration
- ✅ Redis caching
- ✅ Kafka event publishing/consuming
- ✅ Docker containerization
- ✅ Environment-based configuration

## 🚧 In Progress

- Database migrations setup
- Complete HTTP endpoint implementations
- Authentication/authorization

## 📋 Future Enhancements

- Asset storage integration (MinIO/S3)
- File upload/download capabilities
- Metadata management
- Search and filtering
- Rate limiting
- Monitoring and metrics
- CI/CD pipeline

## Goals

- ✅ High-performance gRPC communication
- ✅ Scalable microservice architecture
- ✅ Event-driven design
- ✅ Centralized activity logging
- ⏳ Secure, controlled access to assets
